def best_schedule(weekly_income, competitions):
    ''' This function is used to search for the largest income + winning within the week by using brute force smartly.
    :Input: A list of weekly_income and a list of tuple of competitions
    :Output: The maximum amount of money that can be earned
    :Time Complexity: Best and worst case will be the same (the loop did not exit early) which is O (N log (N)),

    :Explanation: An extra memo list is created and convert the weekly_income list into list of tuples

def best_itinerary(profit, quarantine_time, home):
    ''' This function is used to search for the maximum profit within the days and cities by using brute force 
    smartly. Salesperson has 3 decisions to move around the city either stay, move left or move right. It 
    takes one day to move from city to city and each city has instituted a policy of having travelerâ€™s quarantine.
    :Input: A list of lists of profit which represent different day and city (profit[day][city]), a list of 
            quarantine_time that is required to quarantine before working at the city and home is an integer 
            between 0 to n-1 inclusive, where n is the length of city.
    :Output: Maximum amount of money that can be earned by the salesperson by walking through the best path of the city.
    :Time Complexity: Best and worst case will be the same (the loop did not exit early) which is O (ND), 
                      where N is the length of cities and D is the number of days.
    :Auxiliary Space Complexity: O (ND),  where N is the length of cities and D is the number of days. 
                                 As it is a matrix so it required ND extra space to keep track of the maximum profit.
    :Space Complexity: O (ND + ND) = O (2ND) = O (ND), space complexity is input space + extra space.
                       The input space is O (ND) where N is the length of cities and D is the number of days.
                       The extra space is O (ND) as well where N is the length of cities and D is the number of days. (explained above)
    :Explanation: A ND size of memo is created and initialized the list of lists of lists of the memo which is 
                  the most inner  lists. The most inner list consists of 3 elements (move, quarantine, stay) which are 
                  the maximum profit that MOVE from other city, the previous maximum profit that move from other 
                  city is saved meanwhile it is used to update or insert the maximum profit at the day after 
                  QUARANTINE at the city, the maximum profit that STAY at the same city or stay at new city after 
                  moving around. Three decisions need to make at each city either stay, move left or move right. By 
                  comparing the first element of the most inner lists which is move and the last element of the most 
                  inner lists which is stay, the largest profit from both is saved at the last element of the most inner 
                  lists. The maximum amount of money that can be earned by the salesperson is the maximum value 
                  of the last element of the most inner lists on the last day.
